# PhyTeXia

PhyTeXia is a LaTeX package for writing guides for the card game Magic: The Gathering in LaTeX.

PhyTeXia supplies the user with a number of macros to include cards, images, mechanics and MTG-specific symbols in LaTeX documents.
Note that PhyTeXia relies heavily on LuaTeX and will thus only work with such compilers.

## Features
This section includes both completed and planned features while development is still ongoing.
- Include cards into your documents by just their name. Card images are downloaded using the API of [Scryfall](scyfall.com) in the background.
- Include card tooltips in your documents (only works in Adobe Acrobat).
- Include an automatic glossary of cards that you can refer to.
- Macros for all sorts of MTG mana symbols, including all colors of mana, colorless and generic mana, hybrid mana and phyrexian mana.
- Include other relevant symbols such as the tap and untap symbol and many more.
- Include decklists in a consistently formatted way from local files or online sites such as moxfield, archidekt, mtggoldfish and many more.
