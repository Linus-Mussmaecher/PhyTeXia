	\section*{Tests -- Symbols}
	The five colors of mana in Magic are \mtgwhite, \mtgblue, \mtgblack, \mtgred\ and \mtggreen .

	In costs, there is also generic mana, such as \mtggeneric{1}, \mtggeneric{20} or \mtggeneric{X}.
	There is no symbol for \mtggeneric{Y}.

	The cost of the card \emph{Supreme Verdict} is \mtggeneric{2}\mtgwhite\mtgblue .

	Each man cost also has Phyrexian equivalent, which can be paid with either 1 mana of the appropriate color or 2 life, e.g. \mtgUP{} can be paid with either \mtgU{} or 2 life.
	These symbols are \mtgWP, \mtgUP, \mtgBP, \mtgRP{} and \mtgGP.

	Similar to Phyrexian mana, so called \emph{2brid mana} can be paid with either 1 mana of a specific color or 2 mana of any color.
	The respective symbols for 2brid mana are \mtgTwoW, \mtgTwoU, \mtgTwoB, \mtgTwoR{} and \mtgTwoG.

	Lastly, one card in Magic (namely \emph{Ulalek, Fused Atrocity}) uses a special form of hybrid mana that can be paid with either mana of a specific color or colorless mana.
	Ulalek uses the symbols \mtgCW, \mtgCU, \mtgCB, \mtgCR{} and \mtgCG.

	Finally, we have the most basic form of hybrid mana that can be paid with one of two specific colors.
	These were introduced on the plane of Ravnica and are often associated with their guilds.
	They also each exist in a phyrexian variant.

	Lastly, there is also snow mana (\mtgS), which is mana of any color that was produced by a snow source.
	\mtgSnow{} mostly appears in costs of abilities instead of cards.

	Notice that the size of symbols changes with the surrounding font size:

	Next, we use the \texttt{\textbackslash mtgcost}-Command to display the mana costs of some cards.
	\begin{table}[h]
		\begin{tabular}{c c}
			\textbf{Card}          & \textbf{Cost}                 \\
			Surpeme Verdict        & \mtgcost{{2}{U}W}             \\
			Rakshasa's Bargain     & \mtgcost{{2/B}{2/U}{2/G}}     \\
			Prismari Pledgemage    & \mtgcost{{U/R}{U/R}}          \\
