% \subsection{Basic Mana Symbols}
% First, we define five commands for the basic colors of mana:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand{\mtgwhite}{\texttt{W}}
\newcommand{\mtgblue}{\texttt{U}}
\newcommand{\mtgblack}{\texttt{B}}
\newcommand{\mtgred}{\texttt{R}}
\newcommand{\mtggreen}{\texttt{G}}
%    \end{macrocode}
% This command will form the basis of many other commands.
