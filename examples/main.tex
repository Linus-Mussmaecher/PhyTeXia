	\maketitle

	\emph{PhyTeXia} is a \LaTeX{} package for writing guides and other documents for the card game \emph{Magic: The Gathering} in \LaTeX{}.

	PhyTeXia supplies the user with a number of macros to include cards, images, mechanics and MTG-specific symbols in \LaTeX{} documents.
	Note that PhyTeXia relies heavily on LuaTeX and will thus only work with compatible compilers.
