	\maketitle

	\emph{MTG Vortex} is a \LaTeX package for writing guides for the card game \emph{Magic: The Gathering} in \LaTeX.

	VorTeX supplies the user with a number of macros to include cards, images, mechanics and MTG-specific symbols in \LaTeX documents.
	Note that VorTeX relies heavily on LuaTeX and will thus only work with compatible compilers.
